- 👋 Hi, I’m @100000s
- 👀 I’m interested in developing tradable bitcoin banknotes using primarily off-the-shelf technology with automated creation of lightning "paper wallets" en masse with a fixed amount of satoshis (100000).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the options available for marketing this product initially in El Salvador, where btc has become legal tender.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with coders familiar with the pertenant technical requirements for this project.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at civ1 at protonmail dot com.
