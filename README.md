- 👋 Hi, I’m @100000s
- 👀 I’m developing a timed and escrowed auction mechanism for the circulation of pre-loaded ISO 14298 Intergraf-certified satoshi-denominated banknotes in six denominations, with oracles signalling predetermined events triggered by the valuation of the BTC/USD trading pair.
- 🌱 I’m also exploring the options available for marketing this product for common use initially in El Salvador, where btc has become legal tender, and other bitcoin-friendly countries with limited internet access.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with Solidity, Rootstock, and Chainlink coders familiar with the pertenant technical requirements for this project. You can view the doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anLvZmTtphHOWqWTc-EUIHtyb6SUMjN7BI3wtUpad0M/edit?usp=sharing.
